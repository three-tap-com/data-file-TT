<h1>NATURE CLUB<img src="http://www.nitw.ac.in/nitw/images/nature-image.jpg"></h1>
<h3><span><b>PURPOSE:</b></span></h3>
<h4>“The Greatest Threat to Nature is to believe that someone else will save it.”</h4>
<p>_Realizing this_&nbsp;Na_t_<span>ure</span>_<span>&nbsp;club NITW has always been committed in sensitizing the students on issues related to Environment.</span><b><span></span></b></p>

<h1><b>CENTER FOR VALUE EDUCATION</b></h1>
<h4>PURPOSE OF CENTER FOR VALUE EDUCATION:</h4>
<p>“Education without values is a dangerous instrument” so the saying goes. In the present day context where a person tends to adopt a fast busy life without any emphasis for lifestyle management, people may easily fall prey to unethical and immoral practices. This affects not only him but influences negatively people around him as well.</p>
<p>Our former president Abdul Kalam says rightly that educational institutes while imparting knowledge of subjects should also create a favorable environment for the maturing of a real personality of a student-which becomes possible by inspiring him to lead a life based on values and ethics. He will then become capable of taking informed decisions for choosing a path which is in harmony with divine virtues like peace, tolerance etc.</p>
<p>Centre for Value Education shares the philosophy of Ministry of Human Resource Development of India with the objective of inculcating moral values such as love, truth, righteousness, peace, nonviolence and patriotism among students. The main motive of this centre is to produce engineers and technologists with a good character and humane. The center arranges lectures by eminent personalities, debates, discussions and speeches based on the topics related to the centre. The club also ensures that it organizes social activities to inculcate the spirit of social service.</p>
<p>It is endowed with this vision that the Centre for value education club of NIT-W organizes events and competitions for the students. As part of this endeavor, we came out with a monthly newsletter Sanskaar which comprises of interesting articles and inspiring essays written or compiled by the students which help in blossoming of his/her personality. Quizzes and competitions relating to morality, values, culture and heritage are held to ignite the zeal in a student to achieve his/her goal no matter what the obstacles.&nbsp; The Director, Dean (Students Affairs), and the Faculty Adviser for the club were the distinguished guests who attended and spoke in the inaugural event of our club. We also had a presentation for increasing the awareness of the first years about our college. Issues relating to the academic, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities were discussed. Students thus had an overview of the different facets of their four year stay here such as facilities available, fests etc. and we hope that they have gained a clear and fresh perspective of their mission. We hope to carry forward these activities all the yearlong with the co-operation of the students.</p>
