As on 01</span><span><span>st</span></span><span> May 2025, IIT Hyderabad has a student strength of 5249 (2126-BTech, 93-BDes, 24-MA, 1239-MTech, 75-MDes, 218-MSc and 1474-PhD). IITH aims to train well-rounded engineers who are ready to tackle real-world problems. In a short period of time, IIT Hyderabad has emerged as a prestigious institute of higher learning producing students of great caliber. IITH is creating a unique holistic educational ecosystem that will foster interactive learning, cutting edge research, strong industry collaboration, and entrepreneurship. It is providing an environment wherein students and faculty are not afraid to experiment and celebrate their ideas.</span></p>
<br>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Hyderabad campus is spread over 599 Acres and 16 Guntas, which is about 60-minute drive from the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Hyderabad, and 30-minute drive from Gachibowli – the IT and financial hub of Hyderabad. The campus buildings are designed by world renowned architects and have the ultra-modern aesthetics with world class amenities. The hostels have a very unique architecture, making it more of a dwelling rather than a student hostel. IITH has a vibrant student gymkhana that oversees all the aspects of the students’ life during their stay at IIT Hyderabad.</span></p>

                    <h4>Academic Structure
                    </h4>
                    <span class="fs-7">
                        <p dir="ltr"><span>The institute offers a large number of Undergraduate, Postgraduate and Doctoral programs in Engineering, Science, Design, Liberal Arts and Entrepreneurship &amp; Management. This includes BTech, BDes, MSc, MTech, MA, MDes and PhD. Currently, IIT Hyderabad has 18 departments + 1 Centre for Interdisciplinary Programs + 1 Greenko School of Sustainability.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>IIT Hyderabad follows a semester system. An Academic Year (July-April) consists of 2 semesters, each approximately 16 weeks’ duration. The first semester begins in the last week of July / first week of August and ends by the last week of November. The second semester starts in the first week of January and ends by the last week of April /first week of May. A student is required to register the relevant courses listed in the curriculum for that semester.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>IIT Hyderabad offers the BTech undergraduate program for students admitted through JEE (Advanced). IITH has implemented a very novel academic program, referred to as, Fractal Academics – the key idea is to atomize courses, provide breadth and depth, emphasize courses in liberal arts as well as creative arts, emphasize project work, and create an interactive learning ambience. A typical 3 credits course leading to 42 lecture hours in a semester. Fractional credits can be 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 having 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 lecture hours, respectively.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The fractal academic program is a novel holistic approach to undergraduate teaching. It has multiple goals among which fostering undergraduate research, interdisciplinary learning and encouraging creativity are the primary ones. In the first year of study, students are introduced right away to a wide gamut of courses not only from the engineering spectrum but also from science and liberal arts. This is aimed at giving the students a flavor of various engineering disciplines in addition to whetting their appetite for the science, creative and liberal arts. In the second year, an in-depth study of the core engineering courses is undertaken. This is designed to firm up the students' foundations in fundamental areas of their chosen branch. In the third year of study, students are encouraged to pick an area of their choice (within their branch) and take relevant elective courses. By the end of the third year, the students are primed to take on challenging research projects. In the final year the interested and eligible students are encouraged to work on research problems. Two common threads run through all four years of study - independent projects and creative/liberal arts courses. Students are required to pursue independent projects to "learn by doing" as well as to explore engineering problems that pique their interests. Through the study of liberal and creative arts, it is hoped that students appreciate non-technical disciplines which in turn should help them become better engineers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In addition, IIT Hyderabad offers ‘semester long internship’, ‘double major’, ‘minor’, ‘honors’, ‘BTech to MTech conversion’ and ‘BTech to PhD conversion’ subject to fulfilment of eligibility criteria by the department and Institute. It may be noted that the Branch change option is discontinued at IIT Hyderabad.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Semester long internship: </span><span>IITH Students can earn 6 credits through a semester-long internship at an industry or academic institution.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Double Major: If a student does say 24 extra credits in a given department, he/she can get a double major.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A “Minor” is awarded to a student after completion of twelve credits. In addition to BTech, the student’s performance in a course is continuously evaluated throughout the semesters and culminates in the award of a Grade on a 10-point scale.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Similarly, “Honors” is awarded to a student after completion of twelve credits with a prescribed set of courses and projects in their own academic curriculum.</span></p>
