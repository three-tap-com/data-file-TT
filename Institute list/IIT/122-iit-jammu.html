</div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div>
<div><font size="3"><b><u>Philosophy</u></b>&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font size="3">The curriculum has been structured to be interdisciplinary and hands-on to cater to the global community's rapidly changing scientific /technological needs. Research focus and Job-market requirements in the current era have been cutting across all disciplines (eg: Bio-engineering, IoT, AI, Data Science, Smart Cities, Energy for the Future, Health Care, Functional and Interactive Devices, Advanced Materials for Innovative Applications to advance our life quality, Smart Manufacturing, Smart Cities, Water Resources, Climate Change, Himalayan Region Logistics, etc.). In such a scenario, we must make flexible and permeable boundaries between various engineering disciplines and programs offered in the Institution. At the same time, we aim to maintain the core flavours of the programs.</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">Engineering is all about solving real-life problems using the sound knowledge of Mathematics and Sciences. And these smart solutions are cutting across boundaries of conventional engineering disciplines and require a proper understanding of how our society functions and its cultural ethos, interpersonal skills, behavioural patterns, humanistic management, etc.&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">The design of IIT Jammu academic curriculum is based on the fundamental premise that the students are coming in the programs to learn, to innovate, and solve the interdisciplinary issues that we need to address by evolving novel engineering system design. The IIT Jammu programs shall target broad expectations from Bachelor’s education in engineering to:&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">(a) Impart knowledge of engineering, technology, and science fundamentals to encourage critical thinking. It will be done in consonance with humanistic and societal needs. Through the structure of our proposed programs, we would encourage the creative design of engineering systems with a connection to a National perspective.</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">(b) Develop sound fundamentals and technical and soft skills to enable relearning in the future.</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">(c) Inculcate professional and ethical conduct.</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">(d) IIT Jammu would like to position itself as an active science-based engineering and technology education lab. Our programs shall aim to create value through entrepreneurial effort.</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">(e) The courses in the programs shall be targeted to “uncover the cores, rather than covering everything”. This approach shall form the basis for innovation.</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div>
<div><font size="3"><b><u>Implementation</u></b>&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font size="3">A four-year undergraduate bachelor's program has been designed to fulfill a particular program's course requirements and expose students to the fundamental concepts of all branches of engineering, technology, and humanities. Emphasis has been laid on devoting a substantial portion of the total credits to experimental education through laboratory experiments and hands-on projects across disciplines. Engineering and basic sciences courses are accompanied by the corresponding lab training in addition to various projects that will be taken up by the students. Design &amp; Practicum education has been incorporated in the academic curriculum from the first semester to introduce, excite, and encourage students and to open avenues for each student to experiment and execute their ideas as they are full of energy and curiosity after their school education. Outreach projects to provide engineering and technological solutions to the real-life problems faced by society and industry are an integral part of the academic curriculum. Research components will be dispersed throughout the program.&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">A concrete program has been proposed that gives equal importance to the Core Engineering subjects, Engineering Foundation, Essential Basic and Applied Science Foundation, HSS core, and Design Practicum. Introduction to various branches of engineering gives them the flexibility to do interdisciplinary projects (like transport, systems development, integrated novel solutions, green energy, health care, waste management, new energy resources, complex manufacturing, etc.), which will give them the freedom to harness their skills in any discipline.</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">Students are encouraged to get a minor degree in any engineering/applied sciences/humanities/management area to fulfil their inter-discipline interests. The curriculum also aims to give a choice to focus and go deeper into an area of specialization.&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">By obtaining the degree, students of IIT Jammu must be able to</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">(i) Pursue higher studies in their domain / in any interdisciplinary area.</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">(ii) Adapt to emerging engineering/scientific/technological trends.</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">(iii) Be a sensitive and responsible engineer, innovator, job creator, and great human being.</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">The academic curriculum is a credit-based system. UG Rules and Regulations will describe discipline-wise credits to be earned and other modalities. Students can pursue additional Minor area degrees/Honors degrees by earning a certain number of credits. Each credit is equivalent to 1 hour of classroom teaching / 2 hours of laboratory training. It also requires 2-3 hrs of beyond-classroom study per credit. Further details can be obtained from the academic office.</font></div>
