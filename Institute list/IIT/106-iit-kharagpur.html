<p><b><font size="3" color="#990033">In line with the spirit of National Educational Policy (NEP 2020), IIT Kharagpur introduced several path-breaking reforms in its UG programmes since the academic year 2024-25.</font></b></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">1. A</span>dmission to all UG programmes will be for 4-year, B.Tech. and BS levels only.
<a name="x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x__Hlk165911212">The students will get an opportunity to opt for the 5-year dual degree programmes after 2nd or 3rd year of their study</a>. Depending upon their suitability and interest, the students can choose a 5- year dual degree programme in his/her parent department or he/she can also choose the Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Programmes (IDDP) offered by several schools and centres of the Institute. This will also create interesting possibilities such as a BS in Economics with M.Tech. in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning or a B.Tech. (Hons.) in Civil Engineering with M.Tech. in Financial Engineering etc. These changes will facilitate the students to make informed choice after spending few semesters at IIT Kharagpur for Dual Degree, instead of making the choice before they join the institute.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">2.&nbsp;</span>The branch change option at the end of the first year for UG students admitted through JEE (Advanced) was abolished in 2024. This was done to reduce the level of stress some students undergo to secure higher grades for branch change due to availability of the option.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">3.</span>The UG students will have the option of earning simultaneously a “Double Major” along with the B.Tech (Hons.) or BS (Hons.) degree in the departments in which they take admission. The “Double Major” programme will be offered by several departments. Depending upon their interest and aptitude, the students can register for “Double Major” in any discipline after 1st year. For example, a student pursuing B.Tech (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering can opt for a “Double Major” in “Economics” or a student pursuing BS (Hons.) in Physics can opt for a “Double Major” in “Electronics and Electrical Communications Engineering” or “Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning”.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">4.&nbsp;</span>IIT Kharagpur has a Semester Away Program (SAP) for the undergraduate students. Under SAP, a UG student can spend one semester either in another reputed national or international institute or industry or research laboratories and earn full credits equivalent to the semester credits. If required, the UG students can also combine their mandatory summer internship of 8-weeks along with the semester long SAP program, thus getting an opportunity to spend almost 8 months in another reputed organization/industries anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">5.&nbsp;</span>In addition, the institute also offers the students the possibility of earning a “Minor” or a “Micro-Specialization” in many of the disciplines of their interest. Taking into account the rapid developments in “Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML)” and its huge potential for the nation, studying at least one AI/ML elective is mandatory for all the students along with several other electives being offered in areas such as Linguistics, Happiness and Well-Being, Indian Knowledge Systems, Performing Arts etc. The institute also encourages the UG students to attend national and international conferences of repute and make presentations of the research work that they do at IIT Kharagpur by supporting them<span> financially and promoting the creativity of the </span>students through establishment of several Innovation Labs, Do-It-Yourself centres, Tinkering Labs, Tech Clubs etc.</p>

<div><b>AEROSPACE ENGINEERING</b></div>
</font>
<p></p>
<font face="null" size="3">
<div>Aerospace engineering deals with the science of flying vehicles heavier than air. Aerospace also deals with science to fly in the atmosphere of Earth (aeronautics) and surrounding space (astronautics). Aerospace Engineering mainly deals with four distinct disciplines e.g., Aerodynamics, Aerospace Structures, Flight Mechanics/Space Dynamics and Control, and Propulsion. Aerodynamics is the study of how gases interact with moving bodies. Because the gas that we encounter most is air, aerodynamics is primarily concerned with the forces of drag and lift, which are caused by air passing over and around solid bodies.&nbsp; Aerospace structures&nbsp;differ from other structures due to their high demands for performance and lightweight.&nbsp; Aerospace structures explore the structural and material design of aircraft and spacecraft from the viewpoint of an aerospace engineer. Modern aerospace structures typically require the use of composite materials, advanced multi-functional materials and thin-walled constructions. Flight mechanics are relevant to fixed wing (gliders, aeroplanes) and rotary wing (helicopters) aircraft. The smooth flight of modern airplanes is mainly dependent on automatic control and sophisticated Flight Mechanics models. On the other hand, Space Dynamics deals with the satellite orbital motion and its orientation control. This forms the backbone of modern communication and extra-terrestrial exploration. Propulsion means to push forward or drive an object forward. The term is derived from two Latin words: pro, meaning before or forward; and pellere, meaning to drive. A propulsion system consists of a source of mechanical power, and a propulsor (means of converting this power into propulsive force). A technological system uses an engine or motor as the power source (commonly called a power plant), and wheels and axles, propellers, or a propulsive nozzle to generate the force. Components such as clutches or gearboxes may be needed to connect the motor to axles, wheels, or propellers. In a concise form one can say that the aerospace engineers are concerned with the analysis and design, construction, testing and operation of flight vehicles, including aircraft, helicopter, rockets and spacecraft. The course is based on the fundamentals of aerodynamics, solid mechanics and aircraft structural materials, structural analysis, propulsion, aerospace vehicle design, space dynamics, automatic control and guidance, and development of flight control software.&nbsp;</div>
