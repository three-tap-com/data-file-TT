<p></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Institute offers high-quality academic programs leading to B.Tech., B.S. and Dual Degree programs in thirteen disciplines; B.S. in Medical Sciences and Engineering, B.S. in Chemistry; M.Sc. in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics; M.Tech. in several advanced streams; M.B.A, E.M.B.A; M.A. (in Economics, Development Studies, and English Studies), and research degrees through the M.S. and Ph.D. programs and online B.S. in Data Science and Applications degree, with an exit option for a B.Sc. in Programming and Data Science, B.S. in Electronic Systems degrees through its technology, engineering, science, management, and humanities and social sciences departments. Students seeking a wholesome, academically rigorous, intellectually challenging, personally enriching and value-laden educational experience have for long found IIT Madras an ideal Institute for pursuing their higher studies.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The four-year B.Tech./B.S. and the five-year dual degree (B.Tech. + M.Tech.) programmes consist of an amalgamation of core courses in the chosen engineering/science discipline along with courses in basic sciences, humanities and practical engineering skills. Laboratory courses and an industry internship give students a platform to test the fundamentals acquired in the classroom. The Institute follows a policy of relative grading and continuous assessment done through class tests, assignments and examinations. The curriculum of the five-year dual degree programme is common with the four-year programme for the first three years, after which electives are offered based on the chosen M.Tech. specialization.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The design of the undergraduate curriculum at IIT Madras and course-work requirements in both programs is designed to be highly flexible, with various stream-specializations within each program.&nbsp; Electives constitute nearly 50% of the curriculum at IIT Madras, which also allow students to take courses across different Departments.&nbsp; Students would also have the option of upgrading to a 5-year Dual degree program (i.e. getting an additional MTech or M.S. degree).</span><span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Honours Programme</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span>Students admitted to IIT Madras in four-year B.Tech. or five-year dual degree programmes can opt for B.Tech. (Honours) during fifth semester.</span></p>
<p><span>They should have a minimum CGPA&nbsp;(Cumulative Grade Point Average)&nbsp;of 8.5 (on a scale of 10), and should have cleared all the courses as prescribed in the curriculum in the first attempt. In addition, B.Tech. (Honours) students must complete additional courses specified and a project. Dual degree students who meet the above criteria will be awarded B.Tech. (Honours) and M.Tech. /B.S. (Honours) and M.S. degrees.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Programme Description</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span>With focus on research and development, in the complex changing scenario of today’s industry, IITM curriculum constantly reflects key trends and emerging areas of interest. &nbsp;&nbsp;The curriculum is reviewed regularly and changes are incorporated to enable IITM students to be well-prepared for the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest strengths of the IITM curriculum are its academic rigor and the variety it offers one to pursue one’s interest in diverse disciplines ranging from engineering, technology, pure sciences, management, and humanities and social sciences including economics, sociology, philosophy, development studies and literature. Interdisciplinary learning is encouraged and achieved through the policy of giving students freedom in choosing their electives and minor streams. The curriculum, pedagogy and the atmosphere together infuse in our students a strong spirit of inquiry, the joys of learning, and the excitement of discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Credits</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp;One credit indicates an effort of 50 minutes (<i>1 credit-hour</i>) per working week.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This is a dual degree programme with a B.Tech. in Engineering Design and a M.Tech. with specialization in Biomedical Design. A medical equipment is any instrument, apparatus, or material that is used in diagnosing, treating, and/or preventing diseases in humans. Medical devices constitute one of the fastest growing industries.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An analysis of the costing of medical devices reveals that the highest component is the intellectual content and development costs of the invention, and the actual product cost is very much less by comparison.</span></p>
<p><span>The major objective of this course is to develop biomedical designers who have the background to design, manufacture, test and market such products. Biomedical instrumentation, as referred to in many Indian universities, is usually tuned towards maintenance of medical instrumentation and is heavily biased towards electrical engineering. Though such courses are no doubt important, there is a need to develop biomedical designers, who have an interdisciplinary background in mechanical design, controls, mechatronics and manufacturing science. Apart from this they should be well versed in human anatomy and physiology, mechanics as applied to physiology and biology, biosensors, protocol and procedures for animal models, signal processing and so on. This programme systematically imparts the corresponding skills.</span></p>

These pave the way for students to develop their&nbsp;talent, passion and skills and also to showcase their abilities.&nbsp; Many explore new dimensions of their interests to discover their passion.</span></p>
<p><span>Many competitions and festivals are held.&nbsp; The prominent ones are the technical festival named&nbsp;<b>Shaastra,</b> the cultural festival named&nbsp;<b>Saarang,
</b><span>and the entrepreneurship related assemblage named E-Summit</span>.&nbsp; There are other festivals, such as Shaastra-Juniors, and many smaller versions of festivals conducted by the clubs on campus such as Quiz Fest, (Lit-Fest), etc.&nbsp; Apart from these, some departments also conduct special festivals at different times in the year. Some of the prominent ones are CEA Fest, Exebit, Biofest, Amalgam, Forays, Wavez, Mechanica, Samanvay, and Chemclave.</span></p>
<p><span>Descriptions of some of these activities and facilities are provided below:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Centre for Innovation (CFI)</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span>Envisioned to&nbsp;promote student invention and innovation, with a focus on technology environment, this ‘student lab’ at IIT-Madras was set up with funds donated by the Alumni batch of 1981.&nbsp; It makes a positive impact to the environment and society with its contributions. This lab serves as an intellectual environment to provide facilities to the students to work on hands-on engineering activities. This lab supplements&nbsp;the engineering learnt in class with another important component of engineering: Innovation and Creativity.</span></p>
<p><span>Since its inception, CFI has played a major role in fostering student interest in technical activities, through various projects that it has funded and supported. A few of them are even being patented, depending upon the social and economic impacts of the project. CFI has also been associated with several major, long-term projects and competitions such as Robocon and Formula-SAE.

<p><b><span>Lit Soc activities</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span>Lit Soc is&nbsp;a yearlong inter-hostel battle royale. All the hostels go head to head over the course of the academic year and battle it out with each other trying to win different competitions in an effort to get the necessary points to take the Lit Soc cup home at the end of the year and be crowned champions. The various events have different points and special points are awarded to enthusiastic and talented&nbsp;freshers! Freshie events are also be held towards the beginning of the odd semester to initiate them into Lit Soc and give them a feel of how intense and enjoyable Lit Soc events can be. It is a matter of great pride for a hostel to win Lit Soc and as a resident of your hostel, it will be up to you to help your hostel win it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Tech Soc activi<a name="x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_h.gjdgxs"></a>ties</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span>Very simply put, Tech-Soc was born as a tournament where hostels could compete against each other in all tech-related&nbsp;events for points, power and fame. Tech-Soc was started in 2005 and has since then grown steadily, adding events to its repertoire every year. Together with Schroeter and Lit-Soc, it forms the set of three independent “Big” trophies that hostels compete for every year. Tech-Soc is being re-envisioned as forum with a much wider reach than just inter-hostel events. &nbsp;It has now become the umbrella under which all tech-related student initiatives will be encouraged and nurtured. In the odd semester, various informal sessions like “Fundae”&nbsp;sessions and Tech interaction sessions will also be organized so that the first year students can learn about the tech world they are about to step into. Apart from&nbsp;these, there are various clubs related to the technical activities which one can join. For the tech-savvy we always have something or the other going on. You get to dirty your hands and build stuff on your own or participate in tech quizzes or watch the spectacle as different hostels battle it out in Tech-Soc.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>Shaastra</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span>Shaastra is the annual technical festival of IIT Madras. True to its name, Shaastra (signifying ‘science’) is a celebration of science and technology; a confluence of minds and a melting pot of diverse disciplines. It provides a chance to unleash the engineer and scientist within us, providing glimpses of the elegance and scope of evolving technology.</span></p>
<p><span>Shaastra has so far seen 15 editions, having started in its current avatar in the year 2000. It is scheduled to be held over four days and four nights during the first week of January. Shaastra is a veritable engineer’s paradise where fervent enthusiasts congregate, compete, learn and&nbsp;enjoy. Intense competitions, spectacular demonstrations, world-class lectures and a variety of informative workshops are just the tip of the iceberg. Shaastra attracts an immense number of participants from diverse technical, scientific and managerial backgrounds ranging from college students to graduates, from&nbsp;academicians to professionals, from design engineers to managers. The fest holds the distinction of being the first student managed event in the world to implement a Quality Management System and earn ISO 9001:2008 certification by TUV. This has been done to ensure that the standards of the festival are maintained at the highest level and assure our sponsors a consistent degree of exposure at Shaastra.</span></p>
<p><span>This is the platform to showcase our knowledge and enthusiasm. Shaastra is our way of celebrating our love for the spirit of engineering. And in the process we plan to give our visitors a show they will never forget. Shaastra has always been a phenomenal learning&nbsp;experience for the organizers and the participants alike. So at the end of the day we go back feeling&nbsp;much wiser and happier. Of course, if you are not a hard-core techie, don’t worry! We’ve got you covered too. Just walk in for a pleasant surprise. Shaastra nights are the icing on the cake. Laser shows, fireworks displays and so much more each year, proving that you don’t always need the know-how to appreciate what science can do. This is just a glimpse of the sort of stuff we have in Shaastra every year. How much more you uncover is entirely up to you. So welcome, make yourselves at home, and remember - don’t be shy when it comes to revealing the engineer in you.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Saarang</span></b><span></span></p>
<p><span>IIT Madras has seen a glorious 56 year journey, punctuated by many milestones – one of which was the advent of Mardi Gras, a pioneer student cultural extravaganza. Mardi Gras has the distinction of having hosted Uriah Heep, in one of their rare world tours, Buddha’s Babies and even A R Rahman as a college student. Almost forty years later, the legacy lives on, albeit in a new avatar as Saarang.</span></p>
<p><span>Saarang has always made heads turn. It is one of the largest cultural festivals in India attracting over 50,000&nbsp;people&nbsp;from around the country.

Be it the theatre arts, musical displays such as Decibels or the laugh out loud wackiness of extempore and Just-A-Minute, Saarang always has the crowds screaming for more.</span></p>
<p><span>The mainstay at Saarang has always been the 4 Professional Shows, with past editions having seen performances by prominent classical artists such as Balamurali Krishna, Ustad Bismillah Khan, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia; international acts such as Opeth and Skidrow; as well as light music shows by Shaan, S.P. Balsubramaniam, Shankar Ehsaan Loy, Karthik, KK, Benny Dayal, Lucky Ali, Udit Narayan and Sonu Nigam.</span></p>
<p><span>Be it the acoustics, sound Systems, stage or seating capacity, Saarang promises a memorable experience for everyone. A large fraction of the student community works around the clock for months to ensure a better Saarang each time around. Cherishing the support of a bevy of sponsors throughout previous years, Saarang has always managed to strike a chord with the people who flock to see it all happen.</span></p>

<p>The Inter-IIT Sports Meet is the biggest annual sporting event among all IITs, held in December after the odd semester. It rotates among the IITs and is the ultimate platform for student-athletes to showcase their talent, build camaraderie, and experience fierce but friendly competition.</p>
<p>There are two major events:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Inter-IIT Aquatics Meet (October)</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>Inter-IIT Main Sports Meet (December)</p>
<p>The institute with the best overall performance wins the prestigious General Championship (GC).</p>
<p>IIT Madras has a rich legacy in these events, winning the GC 19 times out of 47 meets and an incredible 11 times in a row, a testament to the high level of training, dedication, and sportsmanship displayed by our students.</p>
