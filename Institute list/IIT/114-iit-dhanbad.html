                    </h4>
                    <span class="fs-7">
                        <p><font face="times new roman, times, serif" size="3">Standing tall since the early decades of the 20th century, the Institute is steadily sailing through the millennium change and has emerged into one of the most prominent institutions - Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) with full bloom functioning of 17 branches of Engineering, Applied Sciences, Management Studies, and Humanities. IIT (ISM) has long centenary credentials of outperforming achievements/contributions in academia and the industry.</font></p>
<p><font face="times new roman, times, serif" size="3">The Indian National Congress at its XVII Session of December 1901 passed a resolution stating that “<i><font color="#0000cc">in view of the fact that the tendency of recent legislation, namely, The Indian Mines Act VII of 1901, is that all Indian mines must be kept under the supervision of mining experts, the Congress is of the opinion that a Government College of Mining Engineering should be established in some suitable place in India on the models of the Royal School of Mines in England, Mining Colleges of Japan and at other places in the continent</font></i>”. The McPherson Committee formed by Govt. of India recommended the establishment of an institution for imparting education in the fields of Mining and Geology, whose report, submitted in 1920, formed the main basis for the establishment of the Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad.</font></p>
<p><font face="times new roman, times, serif" size="3">The Indian School of Mines was formally opened on 9th December 1926 by Lord Irwin, the then Viceroy of India, to address the need for trained manpower related to mining activities in the country with disciplines of Mining and Applied Geology. In 1967 it was granted the status of a deemed-to-be university under Section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956. Since its establishment, IIT (ISM) has undergone considerable expansion of its activities, and presently it can be considered a total technology education institute.</font></p>
<p><font face="times new roman, times, serif" size="3">Situated in the heart of the country’s prime coking coal belt, 260 kms from Kolkata, with a campus spread over an area of 393 acres (with 218 acres of existing campus and 175 acres under acquisition and development), the fully residential IIT (ISM) has all the facilities of world-class academic Institute. What started as an institution to impart mining education has graduated into a full-fledged technical institution of international acclaim, offering a host of programs like B. Tech., M. Tech., M. Sc. Tech., MBA, and Ph.D.</font></p>
<p><font face="times new roman, times, serif" size="3">IIT (ISM) is striving relentlessly to become and remain a nationally and internationally acclaimed premier institution of higher technical and scientific education with social commitment having an ethos for intellectual excellence, where initiative is nurtured, where new ideas, research, and scholarship flourish, where intellectual honesty is the norm and from which will emerge the leaders and innovators of tomorrow in the realm of technology. While catalyzing a developing society, its goal as one of the premier technical education institutions in the country would be to intimately involve itself not just in the nation's technological development but indeed in its overall development.</font></p>
