<p><b><span>2) BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND BIOENGINEERING</span></b></p>
<p><span>B.Tech. program in biological sciences and bioengineering (BSBE) at IIT Kanpur was started in 2004. The program provides a unique fusion of biology with other basic and engineering sciences. There is no prerequisite of biology at school level for admission in this program. The goal of this program is to prepare the students, both in theory and practice, for leadership in the globally competitive fields of Life Science, Bioengineering/Biomedical Engineering, Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology industry, academia and research. The program has been developed to meet the increasing demand in these fields of industry and research. The students of BSBE will take courses common with all other branches of science and engineering in the first year. During their second year, they will take foundation and elective courses in basic biology and bioengineering topics, besides developing their interest and excitement in biological experimentations and discoveries. Concepts in biology will be developed to provide a holistic view and to facilitate integration of these concepts with the fundamental principles of physics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering. The final two years of the program will be dedicated to the development of the professional competence of the students on a broad spectrum of topics. These include cell and molecular biology, structural and computational biology, biomaterials, tissue engineering, downstream processing, bioengineering, genetics and genomics, neuroscience and neurobiology. Major emphasis during the final semesters will be on research and development and focus will be on development of entrepreneurial skill as well. Students would also compete for “Joy Gill Endowment” scholarship for R&amp;D internship in Biopharma and Biotech industries besides participating in Bio-business plan competitions. UG students will have the opportunity to win the Summer Internship Award and this award is given based on the work carried out during summer internship. The UG students also get an opportunity to upgrade their registered program into a 5 years dual degree (BT-MT) program where they can get also get an MTech degree in Biological Sciences and Bioengineering.</span></p>
