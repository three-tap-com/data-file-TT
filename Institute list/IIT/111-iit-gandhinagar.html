<div dir="ltr" align="left"><span>
<p dir="ltr">IIT Gandhinagar offers a 4-year BTech programme in eight disciplines - Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Integrated Circuit Design &amp; Technology, Materials Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. The curriculum is futuristic with an emphasis on learning by doing and includes significant exposure to the humanities and social sciences, mandatory courses in life sciences and design, and several options for students to explore their interests through a large number of electives and project courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Flexibility is built into the curriculum with numerous electives, liberal branch change norms, various minors, honours, dual-major programs, and short courses offered by visiting scholars and industry experts..</p>
<p dir="ltr"><u>Branch Change:</u> To provide an environment where students are free to develop their passions, IIT Gandhinagar has adopted a liberal policy for branch/programme change. After successful completion of the first semester, students may apply for a branch change. The current guideline for branch change followed at IIT Gandhinagar is as follows:</p>
</span>
<ol>
<li><span>A student with a CPI of 9.50 or higher is allowed a change of branch without any restriction.</span></li><li><span>For others, change is considered in order of merit determined by the CPI (with a minimum of 6.50 without any fail grade/backlogs eligible) and the strength of the student’s current and desired branch.</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p dir="ltr"><u>Dual-Major Options:</u> BTech students can also opt for a Dual-Major Programme during their course of study to earn an additional BTech degree in a second branch of their choice. For example, a BTech student in Chemical Engineering could opt for a second BTech in Computer Science &amp; Engineering.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><u>Dual-Degree Options:</u> BTech students can also choose to sign up for the Dual-Degree Programme enabling them to get an MTech or an MSc degree in a branch of their choice (possibly diﬀerent from their BTech branch) in addition to the BTech degree, usually by spending an additional year. Two separate degrees are awarded upon successful completion of the requirements of the two programmes. For example, a BTech student in Computer Science &amp; Engineering could opt for an additional MSc degree in Mathematics or an MTech degree in Electrical Engineering.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><u>Minors Programme:</u> A student enrolled in any branch can opt for one or more minors by completing additional relevant courses. The following minors are currently available at IIT Gandhinagar:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Archaeological Sciences, Artificial Intelligence, Automobile Engineering, Biological Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Cognitive Science, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Data Analytics, Design, Earth Sciences, Electrical Engineering, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Integrated Circuit Design &amp; Technology, Management, Materials Engineering, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Quantum Technologies, Robotics, Safety Engineering, and Sustainable Development.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, a BTech student in Mechanical Engineering can opt for a Minor in Computer Science &amp; Engineering and/or a Minor in Management.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><u>Honours Programme:</u> A provision of Honours is available to all students as an add-on to the BTech degree. Students can complete courses and projects in addition to the minimum requirements of a BTech degree to enhance the core competence in their discipline and earn a BTech with Honours.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><u><span>Semester-Long External Exposure:</span></u><span>&nbsp;BTech students can spend their seventh semester pursuing external exposure activities such as industrial internships, external academic engagements, exposure in R&amp;D labs, and start-ups while also earning credits (up to 16) that can be counted towards graduation requirements.</span></span></p>
<u>Other Academic Opportunities:</u> Undergraduate students also have significant opportunities for additional learning through various internships both in India and abroad. Many students also take up internships in industry, thus bringing a real-world, application-oriented perspective to their education. These programmes are supported through generous scholarships.

                    </h4>
                    <span class="fs-7">
                        <p dir="ltr"><span>IIT Gandhinagar’s student-centric approach emphasizes student responsibility, independence, and physical and emotional well-being.

<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Flagship Programmes and Initiatives&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span><u>Foundation Programme:</u></span><span> The Institute’s ﬂagship Foundation Programme is now being emulated by several IITs and other colleges. This programme nurtures students’ creativity, communication skills, ethics, physical ﬁtness, and social awareness, thereby setting the foundation for the creation of engineers who are not just technically sound but also socially aware and responsible citizens. Such “life skills” are emphasized throughout the student’s stay at the Institute through various other activities.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><u>International Opportunities:</u> </span><span>A significant number of undergraduate students typically participate in study abroad or other international opportunities before graduation. These opportunities developed through partner collaborations are funded entirely by the Institute and its international partners at virtually no cost to students.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><u>Student Leadership Initiative:</u> </span><span>Leadership development and life skills are among the core pillars of IIT Gandhinagar’s educational experience. Leadership is woven through a student’s journey at IIT Gandhinagar and embedded in many ways, both tangible and intangible. In partnership with the Indira Foundation, IITGN offers a regular sequence of workshops, short courses, events, one-on-one tutoring sessions, etc., around leadership. They cover a wide range of competencies, such as oral and written communications, people skills (team, collaboration, and leadership), critical and visionary thinking, and physical and mental health, which are all crucial for personal satisfaction and professional success, regardless of career paths chosen.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><u>Explorer Fellowship:</u></span><span> The IITGN Explorer Fellowship is an annual summer programme that enables students,&nbsp; organised in small teams,&nbsp; to undertake a six-week adventure across the country.&nbsp; The programme empowers students to plan and travel with a limited budget throughout the country to observe&nbsp; India intimately at the grassroots level and encounter diverse cultures and lifestyles.&nbsp; The fellowship is entirely funded by the Institute and requires no costs to be borne by the students.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><u>Gram Fellowship:</u></span><span> The IITGN Gram Fellowship aspires to sensitise the students towards the concerns of rural living by exposing its students to rural India. This fellowship is for the students to experience the life of common people who may not have access to suﬃcient resources. It would also be an opportunity for the fellows to think beyond technological interventions to address the concerns of the community. The fellowship is entirely funded by the Institute and requires no costs for the students.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><u>Campus Jobs:</u></span><span> The “On-Campus Employment Opportunities (oCEO)” programme aims to provide students with ﬁrst-hand employment and job experience.&nbsp; This programme is meant to help the students with ‘High-Quality&nbsp; Job experience’,&nbsp; ‘Inculcate&nbsp; Higher&nbsp; Responsibility’,&nbsp; ‘Develop&nbsp; Leadership and Life-skills’,&nbsp; ‘Opportunity to&nbsp; Earn', and&nbsp; ‘Meet&nbsp; Human&nbsp; Resource&nbsp; Requirements’&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Institute.&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp; the students can contribute significantly to continuing education programmes and various other initiatives of the Institute.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Academic discussion hours, facilitated by senior students, provide support on more technical matters to students who may be facing challenges in certain courses.</span></p>
</li><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>For the speedy integration of new students into IITGN, 10-12 students are assigned a student guide who acts as a guide and mentor for the student during their first year.</span></p>
</li><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>A robust and proactive counselling service offers a mechanism to address broader issues related to student well-being.</span></p>
